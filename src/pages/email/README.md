## File Structure

```
src/pages/email/
â”œâ”€â”€ Email.jsx          # Main email component
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This documentation

src/services/
â””â”€â”€ emailService.js    # API service for email operations
```

## Component Architecture

### Email.jsx
The main email component that includes:
- **EmailList**: Displays the list of emails with search and filtering
- **EmailViewer**: Shows the selected email content
- **ComposeDialog**: Modal for composing new emails
- **Tab Navigation**: Sidebar with email folders

### emailService.js
Service class that handles all API interactions:
- Email CRUD operations
- File attachment handling
- Bulk operations
- Search functionality
- Email statistics

## API Integration

The email module is designed to work with a RESTful API. The service expects the following endpoints:

### Base URL
```
/api/v1/email
```

### Key Endpoints
- `GET /emails` - Fetch emails with pagination
- `GET /emails/:id` - Get specific email
- `POST /send` - Send new email
- `POST /emails/:id/reply` - Reply to email
- `POST /emails/:id/forward` - Forward email
- `PATCH /emails/:id/read` - Mark as read/unread
- `PATCH /emails/:id/star` - Star/unstar email
- `DELETE /emails/:id` - Delete email
- `GET /search` - Search emails
- `GET /stats` - Get email statistics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Email Operations

```javascript
import emailService from '../../services/emailService';

// Fetch emails from inbox
const emails = await emailService.getEmails('inbox', 1, 20);

// Send a new email
const emailData = {
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Test Email',
  body: 'This is a test email',
  attachments: []
};
await emailService.sendEmail(emailData);

// Mark email as read
await emailService.markEmailAsRead(emailId, true);

// Search emails
const searchResults = await emailService.searchEmails('shipment update');
```

### Component Integration

```javascript
// In your component
import Email from './pages/email/Email';

// Add to your routes
<Route path="/email" element={<Email />} />
```

## Customization

### Styling
The component uses Material-UI theming. You can customize:
- Colors in the theme configuration
- Component spacing and layout
- Typography and fonts

### Email Templates
Add custom email templates by extending the `getEmailTemplates()` method in the service.

### Folder Structure
Modify the `tabs` array in Email.jsx to add or remove email folders.

## Security Considerations

- All API calls include authentication headers
- File uploads are validated for type and size
- Email content is sanitized before display
- User permissions are checked for email operations

## Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Emails are loaded in pages to improve performance
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large email lists (can be implemented)
- **Caching**: Email data is cached in component state
- **Debounced Search**: Search input is debounced to reduce API calls

## Browser Support

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Mobile Responsiveness

The email module is fully responsive and includes:
- Collapsible sidebar on mobile
- Touch-friendly interface
- Optimized layouts for small screens
- Full-screen compose dialog on mobile

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket integration for live email updates
- **Email Threading**: Group related emails into conversations
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated filtering options
- **Email Scheduling**: Schedule emails to be sent later
- **Email Signatures**: Custom email signatures
- **Email Encryption**: End-to-end email encryption
- **Integration**: Integration with external email providers (Gmail, Outlook)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not loading**: Check API endpoint configuration and authentication
2. **Attachments not working**: Verify file upload endpoint and permissions
3. **Search not working**: Ensure search API is implemented
4. **Mobile layout issues**: Check responsive breakpoints

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by adding `console.log` statements in the email service methods to track API calls and responses.
